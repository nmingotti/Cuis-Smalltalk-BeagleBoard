# Cuis-Smalltalk-BeagleBoard
A package to control BeagleBone pins in Smalltalk 

## Objectives, Plan & Status
This package is started on 27-Nov-2021 with zero existing code. The long term plan is to implement this:
* Control GPIO input and output
* Control PWM 
* Control A/D converter
* Interrupts
* (difficult) Interface to the 2 separate computation units for real time processing
* (fun) Make morphs to control graphicall the pin statuses

## Hardware 
In principle the code should work in any **BeagleBone Black**. But I will develop and test 
all in a **BeagleBone AI** because it seems powerfull enough to permit a smooth enough
developement cycle. 

## Testing GPIO output 
* TODO. Schematics & test code
